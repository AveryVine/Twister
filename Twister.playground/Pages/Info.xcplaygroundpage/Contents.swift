 # About Twister 🌪:
 This is an endless sidescrolling game, where your one and only goal is to dodge the incoming blocks. But there's a **TWIST**: you can't move your character up and down! Instead, you must harness the power of 🌀rotation🌀 to swerve between obstacles. Be warned, the game only gets harder as you progress!

 # How to Play:
 ### The Blocks Are Coming! ❗️
 ![Dodge the blocks!](start_of_game.gif)
 The blocks are coming! Your goal, as the mysterious, perpetually rotating dots 🔴, is to avoid the incoming blocks at all costs! They will spawn on the right side of the screen, and you must try to get past them. How, you ask? Look no further than the next set of instructions!
 
 ### Tap to Switch Rotation 🔄
 ![Tap to rotate!](tap_to_rotate.gif)
 There is a unique trait to these blocks: they never come in pairs. This means, with careful timing, you can swap your direction of rotation (by tapping the screen), and swerve right between them!
 
 ### Need for Speed! 💨
 ![The game speeds up!](speeding_up.gif)
 Watch out! Each time you get past enough blocks, the blocks will get *A N G R I E R*, and will speed up! If that wasn't enough, once you clear a certain number of blocks, you'll start to bounce up and down, for extra confusion!
